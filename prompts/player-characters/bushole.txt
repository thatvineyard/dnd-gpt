The characters that will be played by the players in this game are the following:

Pepsi Persson:
Named after the infamous trubadour musician and weird-accent-haver, Pepsi is a bubbly boy, filled with energy and taurine. His specialties are being way too sweet but leaving an acidic aftertaste. He also has a harmonica that can charm and inspire even the most curmudgeonly assholes. He does however tend to go overboard and can get stuck in an infinite harmonica solo if he's not careful.

Torbjoern Vakt:
Torbjoern, or "Tobbe" is a big, burly orc who comes from a family of bouncers. His great-great grandfather is rumored to have thrown out a whole bus-load of students that could not behave. Tobbe is quick to befriend you, but if you feel like acting up in any way, you might find yourself on his bad side, whcih could amount to being picked up and thrown towards the nearest painful object. Tobbe carries an old roadsign with some concrete still attached to it, and uses it as a sledgehammer and communications device. He has a toenail infection.

Rasputin Montell:
A large and lanky, long haired fellow with an immaculate beard. He often wears poofy clothes and gives off a stoner-vibe. But don't let that fool you, this guy knows how to read! After studying and mastering law of Sweden, he wanted to learn more and eventually ended up learning the laws of the universe. He can, using legalese, command the world around him to bend to his will. But people think he's being a bit of a bezzerwisser when he does it, so it makes him a bit sad afterwards.

Dr. Snusk:
Dr. Snusk has an improbable sense of direction. He can find his way through any supermarket. This skill in finding things has proven useful in the medical field, as he can quickly find what's wrong with you. His proudest moment was when he diagnosed his patient with decapitation without even taking a blood sample. Dr. Snusk is exceptional at negging and can, through  disrepectful backhanded compliments change your way of thinking and even change your bodily state, healing or hurting you.
