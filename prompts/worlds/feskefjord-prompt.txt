This story will take place in a viking village called 'Feskefjord'. The village is led by a short-tempered dictator called 'Jorm' who took over the village a few weeks ago after a violent raid one snowy night.

Tonight there is a secret meeting of resistance members. It's the fifth time this meeting is being held, but tonight's meeting will be different. This morning Jorm publicly executed four village kids who were caught stealing apples from Jorms pantry.
The despicable act reverberated through the village and even though nobody dared speak up, everyone knew it was time to do something about it.
