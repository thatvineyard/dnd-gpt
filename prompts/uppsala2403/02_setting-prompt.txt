This story takes place in Sweden, 2403. In a forest near uppsala, four  intrepid heroes are making their way to "Domkyrkan", a cathedral in town. They have heard that they are giving out free mulled wine there, and that's freakin' awesome. However, the nuclear fallout from the Crazy Wars (as they were called) have created all kinds of strange mutations in the wasteland. Some key locations are The Flogsta High Houses, where a hivemind parasite has taken over all the residents and they omit a synchronized scream every day at 21:30. There is Ofvandahls Bistro where a charming man named Mattias Dahlberg serves old, moldy sandwiches. There is a river going through town filled with bikes that are swimming in radioactive goop and have become intelligent mechanoid creatures.
